# Berka Bank Analysis

## Domain
Onde upon a time, there was a bank offering services to private persons.
The services include managing of accounts, offerings loans, etc.

## Task Descripion

The bank wants to improve their services. For instance, the bank managers have only vague idea, who is a good client (whom to offer some additional services) and who is a bad client (whom to watch carefully to monimize the bank loses).

Fortunately, the bank stores data about their clients, the accounts (transactions within several months), the loans already granted, the credit cards issued.

The bank managers hope to improve their undestanding of customers and seed specific actions to improve services.

A mere application of discovery tool will not be convincing for them.

## Data Model
```{r data_model_pic, echo=FALSE, out.width = '800px'}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/data_model.png")
```

## Gender Exploration

At first glance, gender equality is well balanced in the bank, even when observed over the decades. Even
more impressive, gender equility is everywhere in the country.

```{r general_gender_distribution, echo=TRUE, out.width = '100%'}
ggplot(data = client) +
  aes(x = gender, fill = gender) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Gender distribution of clients in the bank",
       subtitle = "A well balanced bank",
       x = "Gender",
       y = "Total clients") +
  theme_economist()
```

```{r gender_distribution_over_decades, echo=TRUE, out.width = '100%'}
clientGenderOverDecades <- client %>% 
  group_by(decade = as.integer(substr(client$birth_number, 1,1)) * 10, gender = client$gender) %>% 
  count()

ggplot(data = clientGenderOverDecades) +
  aes(x = decade, fill = gender, weight = n) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80)) +
  geom_bar() +
  geom_line(aes(y = n, color = gender)) +
  labs(title = "Gender distribution of clients in the bank over the decades",
       subtitle = "Equality at its finest",
       x = "Decades",
       y = "Total clients") +
  theme_economist() +
  facet_wrap(vars(gender))
```

```{r gender_distribution_by_age_region, echo=TRUE, out.width = '100%'}
clientGenderAgeGroupByRegion <- client %>% 
  mutate(age_group = ifelse(age < 21, "young", ifelse(age >= 21 & age <= 60, "adult", "senior"))) %>% 
  inner_join(district, by = "district_id") %>% 
  group_by(age_group, gender, region) %>% 
  count()
  
ggplot(data = clientGenderAgeGroupByRegion, aes(axis1 = region, axis2 = age_group, y = n)) +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c("region", "age group"), expand = c(.1, .1)) +
  xlab("Demographic") +
  geom_alluvium(aes(fill = gender), knot.pos = 0) +
  geom_stratum() + 
  geom_text(stat = "stratum", label.strata = TRUE) +
  theme_economist() +
  ggtitle("Region and age group by gender", "Equality is everywhere") 
```
